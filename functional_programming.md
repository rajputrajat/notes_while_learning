# Functional Programming

## Pure Functions

* must return a value
* mustn't change global state
* input values are immutable
* return is immutable
* same output for same inputs
* no involvement of external states

## map(fn()) and apply(T) -> R

* map() takes a closure as input parameter
* map() is called **Higher-Order function**. because it takes a function as a prameter.
* apply() is a pure function
* another example is filter()
